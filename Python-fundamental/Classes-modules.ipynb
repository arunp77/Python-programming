    "# Classes and Modules in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes and modules are two fundamental concepts in Python programming that play crucial roles in organizing and structuring code. While they share some similarities, they serve distinct purposes and are employed differently in Python applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><h3>Classes:</h3> Classes are the building blocks of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python. They serve as blueprints for creating objects, which are instances of a class. A class defines the characteristics (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of an object. An object class contains 3 fundamental elements:\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li><strong>A constructor: </strong>a function that initializes an object of the class.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Attributes: </strong>Variables specific to the created object used to define its properties and store information.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Methods: </strong>Class-specific functions that allow you to interact with an object.</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "    <p>Explanation:</p>\n",
    "        <ul>\n",
    "            <li>Think of a class as a template for creating objects. </li>\n",
    "            <li>Just as a house blueprint defines the structure, layout, and features of a building, a class defines the properties and behaviors of an object.</li>\n",
    "            <li>For instance, a Dog class might define attributes like <code>name</code>, <code>breed</code>, and <code>age</code>, and methods like <code>bark()</code>, <code>wag()</code>, and <code>eat()</code>.</li>\n",
    "            <li><strong>Example: </strong>Creating an object from a class is similar to constructing a building from a blueprint. You call the class and pass any necessary arguments, and Python creates an instance of the class, assigning it the attributes and behaviors defined by the class</li>\n",
    "        </ul>  \n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li><h3>Modules:</h3> Modules are files containing Python code that can be imported into other Python programs. They provide a way to organize and reuse code, making it easier to manage large projects.\n",
    "        <ul>\n",
    "            <li>Imagine a modular building structure, where each module is responsible for a specific component. </li>\n",
    "            <li>Modules in Python work similarly, dividing code into self-contained units that can be easily incorporated into other programs.</li>\n",
    "            <li>Modules encapsulate code, reducing clutter and improving code readability. They also promote code reusability, allowing you to reuse existing code without repeating it across different programs.</li>\n",
    "        </ul>\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<h4>Key Differences:</h4> The primary distinction between classes and modules lies in their purpose and scope.\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Classes are concerned with creating and managing objects, defining their attributes and behaviors. They embody the concept of OOP, enabling programmers to model real-world entities in a concise and structured manner.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Modules, on the other hand, focus on organizing and reusing code fragments. They provide a means to break down large programs into manageable chunks, improving code maintainability and modularity.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>In summary, classes and modules are essential tools in Python programming. Classes are for creating and managing objects, while modules are for organizing and reusing code. Each serves a distinct purpose, contributing to the clarity, efficiency, and maintainability of Python applications.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General Format of each:\n",
    "- For class:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ClassName:\n",
    "    # Class attributes (data)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Class methods (behavior)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Constructor (initializes object attributes)\n",
    "    def __init__(self, args):\n",
    "        # Assign arguments to object attributes\n",
    "```\n",
    "- FOr object:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "object_name = ClassName(args)\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "1. The constructor of the class of cars is a factory which produces them. The attributes of a car could be its color, its model or its horsepower. The factory must be able to produce a car that matches these specifications. Thus, the factory is analogous to a function which takes as argument the attributes of the car and returns the car built and ready to use.\n",
    "   - The definition of the constructor is done with the method named <code>\\_\\_init\\_\\_</code> which allows us to initialize the attributes of the object that is being built (note that this method takes two underscores before and after <code>init</code>): \n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        # Definition of the Car class\n",
    "        class Car:\n",
    "            # Definition of the constructor of the Car class\n",
    "            def __init__(self, color, model, horsepower):\n",
    "                # Initialization of the attributes of the class with the arguments of the constructor\n",
    "                self.color = color\n",
    "                self.model = model\n",
    "                self.horsepower = horsepower\n",
    "\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "        The self argument corresponds to the object calling the method. This argument allows us to access the attributes of the object within the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - All the methods of a class must have self as the first argument in their definition the argument, because the methods of a class systematically receive the object which calls them as the first argument."
