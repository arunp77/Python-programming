    "With this dataset, we could perform a wide range of analyses and visualizations to understand how the stock price of Deutsche Bank has changed over time, and to identify trends or patterns in the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we could:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a line chart showing the daily closing price of the stock over time.\n",
    "- Calculate the daily percentage change in the stock price, and create a histogram or density plot to visualize the distribution of these changes.\n",
    "- Use technical analysis tools to identify patterns or trends in the stock price, such as moving averages or support/resistance levels.\n",
    "- Perform a regression analysis to model the relationship between the stock price and other variables, such as market indices or macroeconomic indicators.\n",
    "- Use machine learning algorithms to predict future stock prices based on historical data.\n",

    "### Importing important libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Numpy:** NumPy is a Python library for scientific computing that provides support for arrays, matrices, and mathematical functions. It is one of the most widely used libraries in the scientific Python ecosystem, and is a fundamental building block for many other Python libraries. NumPy provides the ndarray (n-dimensional array) data structure, which is a collection of elements of the same type, indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers. NumPy also provides a large number of mathematical functions for manipulating arrays, such as mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.), statistical operations (mean, variance, standard deviation, etc.), and linear algebra operations (matrix multiplication, eigenvalues, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pandas:** Pandas is an open-source Python library that is widely used for data manipulation and analysis. One of the most popular features of Pandas is the DataFrame. It is a two-dimensional table-like data structure that allows you to store and manipulate data in a way that is similar to a spreadsheet. A DataFrame consists of rows and columns, where each row represents a unique observation or record, and each column represents a variable or feature of that observation. You can think of a DataFrame as a spreadsheet, where each row is a record, and each column is a field.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Matplotlib:** Matplotlib is a Python library for data visualization that provides a wide range of tools for creating different types of charts and plots. It is one of the most widely used visualization libraries in the scientific Python ecosystem. Matplotlib provides a variety of functions and classes for creating visualizations, such as scatter plots, line charts, bar charts, histograms, and more. These visualizations can be customized in many ways, including changing the colors, labels, axes, and annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Seaborn:** Seaborn is a Python data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics. It provides a range of functions for visualizing data, including categorical data, relational data, and distributional data. Seaborn includes several built-in datasets that can be loaded directly into a DataFrame, making it easy to get started with visualization. The library also provides a variety of options for customizing charts and plots, such as color palettes, themes, and styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will learn how to create and manipulate DataFrames using and plot using matplotlib/seaborn python libraries."

    "\n",
    "2. Next, the bank uses machine learning techniques such as clustering and classification to identify patterns and potential risks in the data. For example, the bank may use a clustering algorithm to group similar investment products together based on their characteristics, such as credit rating and maturity date. The bank can then analyze the risk profile of each cluster and take appropriate measures to manage the risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The bank may also use classification algorithms to predict the likelihood of default or other risks associated with a particular investment product. This can help the bank make informed decisions about which products to invest in and which to avoid.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Finally, the bank visualizes the data using Python libraries such as `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to communicate the findings to stakeholders. This includes creating charts and graphs that show the distribution of investment products across various categories, as well as the risk profile of each product.\n",
